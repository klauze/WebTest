# TDD / BDD Selenium Sample

Example C# used as a starting point for TDD / BDD class labs. We write simple tests against web sites as part of one of the labs.

This project includes standard integration tests written as a straight MSTest and as BDD (Specflow) based tests for the same scenario.

## Setup
The solution was built in VS2013.
You must enable "Nuget Package Restore" and "Rebuild" this project to pull in all the libraries.
